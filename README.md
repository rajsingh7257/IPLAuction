For the dataset I've scrapped ESPNCricinfo to get the overall records of Test+ODI+T20, the dropped the data of Test records. The intent was to see the pattern of player performance in the given year with the chances of his selection given the player is identified as batsman, bowler or all rounder. 

As soon as we've identified if the player has been selected or not we will try and find the price that would be quoted for the person.
